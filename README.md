Hello, dear people who for some reason enjoy reading README files ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m starting an interesting challenge: committing code every day for 100 days. This is my way of keeping myself motivated to study, learn, and build new projects.

âœ¨ Start date: 9th of October 2025
âœ¨ Finish date: 17th of January 2026

I just hope I wonâ€™t be too lazy to finish it ðŸ˜… â€” but thatâ€™s the whole point of this challenge: building consistency while creating things I care about.

Every week Iâ€™ll post an update in this README so you can keep track of my journey.

Stay tuned â€” letâ€™s see where 100 days of code can take me ðŸš€

I'll create today a log.md file in which I'll post all changes that I make in a day.

Rules for this project:

1. Each day should be made 1 or more commits 
2. Document each day in log.md(what I did, next steps)
3. No empty "update README" commits just to keep streaks.
4. Dedicate at least 1 hour per day to coding, problem-solving, or project work.
5. Try to apply something new at least once a week.
6. Update README.md every week, to keep the info about what I did and what I learned.
7. If I miss a day, I must make it up by doing 2x the work next day.
8. Reporting each miss.
9. By the end of the challenge, publish a showcase portfolio of all projects.
10. Celebrate milestones: Day 25, Day 50, Day 75, Day 100ðŸŽ‰
