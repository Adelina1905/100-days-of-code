Hello, dear people who for some reason enjoy reading README files ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m starting an interesting challenge: committing code every day for 100 days. This is my way of keeping myself motivated to study, learn, and build new projects.

âœ¨ Start date: 9th of October 2025
âœ¨ Finish date: 17th of January 2026

I just hope I wonâ€™t be too lazy to finish it ðŸ˜… â€” but thatâ€™s the whole point of this challenge: building consistency while creating things I care about.

Every week Iâ€™ll post an update in this README so you can keep track of my journey.

Stay tuned â€” letâ€™s see where 100 days of code can take me ðŸš€
