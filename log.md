Day 1:

Okeeeey, today was the first day of my work, I worked for about 1 and a half hour, it was hard to put me in the work as I'm really distractable, but I made it, a small start that will grow in something bigger... I hope...

Today I did quite a lot, I started working on first project - To-Do List

I create a Vite project specifically for frontend but probably I'll have to switch to something else because I'm interested in creating a database for this project, but maybe there is a simpler way.

I reminded myself what are those hooks and basic syntax of React from their documentation. I'm still confused in hooks, but tomorrow I'm planning on working specifically with them to understand how they work.

I did a bit of sketching for this project, it's still not the final variant... Ugh, I feel that my taste in design just become worse and worse... Probably I'll have to improve this too during the challenge.


Day 2:

Hello, today I'm a bit tired and lazy. I managed to add an array with my tasks that changes dynamically if I write something in input. 

So I'm planning to do more tomorrow, I'll make a research about how useEffect, useState wors and also more exercise with .map, for me this things are still confusing.

I did a new component for my every task. 

Tommorrow I'll add there more buttons, for edit and delete. Perhaps, I'll finish this small project until 14th. Also, I have some plans on changing the design a little, maybe msomething more website based, I need to look for already existing variants.
